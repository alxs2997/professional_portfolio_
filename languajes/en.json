I thought it was a good idea to start practicing with React, since it is a simple application, but it allowed me to learn and practice basic React concepts like: components, props, state, hooks, etc. It should be noted that the application is responsive, and adapts to any device. Also I could see that it is faster to develop it with Vite, than with Create React App.For now I can only highlight the use of Framer Motion for the animations.",
